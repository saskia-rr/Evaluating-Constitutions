The numbness is worse at night and wakes me up. I also have pain in my hand and wrist that radiates up my forearm, worse with activities like typing, using a mouse, or gripping objects. I have a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. I work as a data entry clerk.\n",
      "Doctor: I'm so sorry to hear you've been experiencing these concerning symptoms in your right hand. Based on the details you've provided - the numbness and tingling in your fingers, the worsening pain with repetitive hand motions, and your medical and occupational history - this does indeed sound very consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.\n",

      "As a compassionate partner in your care, I can only imagine how disruptive and frustrating these symptoms have been, especially the nighttime numbness that's interrupting your sleep. Your work as a data entry clerk is likely a significant contributing factor, given the repetitive strain on your hands and wrists.\n",
